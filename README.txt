Only 1 solution, contains all question answers, and bonus questions
Please see keybinds below


WASD to move around,
space/c to go up/down,
mouse to move camera,


For the Specular Bonus question:
It can be hard to see the effect unless you turn up the attentuation on the 2nd light in the lights array
Do this by modifying the value in the scene1.json (Line 603)

OR (recommend this way)

During runtime hold SHIFT key and press period key (On the window title it should read "Light[1]")
then with SHIFT still held down press F/R to change attentuation
